- ⚡ About Me:  
  - I enjoy working with the C programming language and learning new things.  
  - I’m always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills.  
  - I love solving challenging problems and turning ideas into functional projects.  

- 🎮 **Pulse Runner**:  
  Pulse Runner is a fast-paced platformer inspired by [Geometry Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Dash). In this game, you control a cube that moves horizontally through levels filled with obstacles and spikes. The goal is to avoid these obstacles by jumping at the right time.  
  Players can unlock new skins and levels by completing stages, and the game features a shop to customize your character's appearance.  
  You can find the project here: [Pulse Runner](https://github.com/sbnh1/pulse-runner).

- 🛠️ **Twisk**:  
  Twisk is a queue simulation tool that allows users to design and test their own workflows. Built with Java for the GUI (JavaFX) and using C for client simulation via multithreading, it integrates both with JNI.  
  Users can design custom workflows, configure client arrival rates, and simulate client processing in real-time. The app supports saving and loading simulation worlds as `.json` files.  
  You can find the project here: [Twisk](https://github.com/sbnh1/Twisk).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Crazy Potion](https://github.com/sbnh1/crazy_potion), a web application for exploring, searching, and managing drink recipes through an ingredient hierarchy, with features like personalized favorites and user accounts.
