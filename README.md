- ⚡ About Me:  
  - I enjoy working with the C programming language and learning new things.  
  - I’m always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills.  
  - I love solving challenging problems and turning ideas into functional projects.  

- 🎮 **Pulse Runner**:  
  Pulse Runner is a fast-paced platformer inspired by [Geometry Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Dash). In this game, you control a cube that moves horizontally through levels filled with obstacles and spikes. The goal is to avoid these obstacles by jumping at the right time.  
  Players can unlock new skins and levels by completing stages, and the game features a shop to customize your character's appearance.  
  You can find the project here: [Pulse Runner](https://github.com/sbnh1/pulse-runner).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Crazy Potion](https://github.com/sbnh1/crazy_potion), a web application for exploring, searching, and managing drink recipes through an ingredient hierarchy, with features like personalized favorites and user accounts
